#C++ project: a "To-Do List Manager."

Project Idea: To-Do List Manager

Description:
Create a command-line application that allows users to manage their to-do lists. The application should provide options for adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, listing all tasks, and removing tasks from the list.

Features:
1. Add Task: Users can enter a new task along with a due date and any additional details. The task should be added to the to-do list.
2. Complete Task: Users can mark a task as completed, indicating that it has been finished.
3. List Tasks: Users can view a list of all tasks in their to-do list, including their status (completed or pending).
4. Remove Task: Users can remove a task from the list, indicating that it is no longer needed.
5. Save and Load: Implement functionality to save the to-do list to a file and load it when the application starts. This allows users to persist their tasks across sessions.

Optional Features (for advanced implementation):
1. Prioritize Tasks: Allow users to assign priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) to their tasks and display them accordingly.
2. Categorize Tasks: Enable users to categorize tasks into different groups (e.g., work, personal, shopping) and provide options to filter and display tasks based on categories.
3. Reminders: Implement reminders for tasks that are approaching their due dates or are overdue.

Implementation Steps:
1. Design the structure of your application, including classes and data structures to represent tasks and the to-do list.
2. Implement the basic functionalities, such as adding tasks, completing tasks, listing tasks, and removing tasks.
3. Add the functionality to save and load the to-do list from a file.
4. Enhance the application by implementing optional features like prioritizing tasks, categorizing tasks, or setting reminders.
5. Test your application thoroughly to ensure all functionalities are working as expected.
6. Consider adding error handling and user-friendly prompts to guide users through the application.

Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks and tackle them one at a time. This will help you manage the complexity and make steady progress. Good luck with your project!
